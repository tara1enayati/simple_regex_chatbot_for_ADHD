How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADHD-Chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ADHD-Chatbot
Run the chatbot:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py
Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries in the terminal. For example:

User: "Hi"
Chatbot: "Hi there! Iâ€™m here to support you. How are you feeling today?"
User: "I struggle with focus"
Chatbot: "Focusing can be tough with ADHD. Try using the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break."
To end the chat, type exit or quit.

Chatbot Logic
The chatbot operates on a set of predefined regex-based rules. For every user input:

The input is matched against the regex patterns.
If a match is found, the corresponding response is displayed.
If no match is found, the chatbot provides a default response.
The rules are stored in a dictionary, where:

Keys: Regex patterns for user inputs.
Values: Responses the chatbot will return.
Customization
You can customize the chatbot by adding or modifying the regex rules in the rules dictionary in chatbot.py. For example:

Add a new pattern for sleep tips:
python
Copy code
r'(.*) sleep': "Good sleep is essential for ADHD. Try sticking to a consistent bedtime routine and limiting screen time before bed."
Future Enhancements
Integrate natural language processing (NLP) for more nuanced conversations.
Add a GUI for better user interaction.
Connect to external APIs for dynamic responses (e.g., weather, reminders).
Support multilingual conversations.
